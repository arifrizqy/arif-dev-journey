# 🚀 Welcome to Arif's Dev Journey!

👋 Hey there!

This repository is a personal log of my journey into the world of programming. It’s where I track what I’m learning, document small experiments, and build up my skills — one step at a time.

As I explore different areas of development, from frontend to backend (and everything in between), this repo will grow to include notes, hands-on projects, and reflections on my progress. It’s an evolving space — both a journal and a learning playground.
